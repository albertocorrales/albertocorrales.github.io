Today, we’ll take the next step and build our own custom MCP server from scratch. We’ll create a practical email validation server that can check if an email address is valid and detect potential spam addresses using a free API.

Enter the Model Context Protocol (MCP) - a game-changing specification that’s revolutionizing how we connect AI models with external tools and data sources. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard developed ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Build Microservices at speed light with Copier</title><link href="https://albertocorrales.com/posts/Copier-template-projects/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Build Microservices at speed light with Copier" /><published>2025-01-26T11:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2025-01-27T08:03:53+01:00</updated> <id>https://albertocorrales.com/posts/Copier-template-projects/</id> <content src="https://albertocorrales.com/posts/Copier-template-projects/" /> <author> <name>Alberto Corrales Garcia</name> </author> <summary> Build Microservices at speed light with Copier Introduction Templating tools are critical in modern microservices architecture, solving key challenges in rapid and consistent software development. They address three primary pain points: Standardization: Ensure consistent project structure, configuration, and best practices across multiple services Productivity: Dramatically reduce setup... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>CI/CD pipelines-as-code with Nuke</title><link href="https://albertocorrales.com/posts/CI-CD-pipelines-as-code-with-Nuke-build/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CI/CD pipelines-as-code with Nuke" /><published>2023-06-05T12:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2023-06-06T11:18:19+02:00</updated> <id>https://albertocorrales.com/posts/CI-CD-pipelines-as-code-with-Nuke-build/</id> <content src="https://albertocorrales.com/posts/CI-CD-pipelines-as-code-with-Nuke-build/" /> <author> <name>Alberto Corrales Garcia</name> </author> <summary> Introduction In order to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), we normally build pipelines. These pipelines are automatically triggered when we build new functionality, we push it into our source code repository, and it is merged into the master branch. As part of this process, we should have some automated or manual quality checks, such us code review, vulnerabilit... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Working with Event Sourcing, CQRS and Web Sockets on AWS</title><link href="https://albertocorrales.com/posts/Working-with-event-sourcing-and-web-sockets/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Working with Event Sourcing, CQRS and Web Sockets on AWS" /><published>2023-01-18T11:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2023-01-19T23:48:16+01:00</updated> <id>https://albertocorrales.com/posts/Working-with-event-sourcing-and-web-sockets/</id> <content src="https://albertocorrales.com/posts/Working-with-event-sourcing-and-web-sockets/" /> <author> <name>Alberto Corrales Garcia</name> </author> <summary> Introduction The WebSocket API is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user’s browser and a server. With this API, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply. We normally use WebSockets when we want to get live updates of a particular object without ... </summary> </entry> </feed>
